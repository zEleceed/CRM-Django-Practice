# NJ'S CRM

NJ'S CRM is a customer relationship management application developed using Django, Python, and MySQL. This project was created as an introductory venture into working with Django and MySQL, following a step-by-step tutorial by John Elder from [Codemy](https://codemy.com/). The application focuses on basic CRM functionalities including user registration, login, record management (add, view, update, delete), all while leveraging MySQL for database management.

## Features
- User authentication (Register, Log In, Log Out)
- CRUD operations for records (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- MySQL database integration
- Basic UI using Bootstrap Templates

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the foundational structure of a Django application (URLs, Views, Templates)
- Implementing CSRF tokens for form security
- Utilizing Bootstrap for frontend design
- Managing database interactions with MySQL
- Encountering and understanding deployment challenges with MySQL and Vercel

## Acknowledgments
- A huge thank you to John Elder from [Codemy](https://codemy.com/), whose tutorial was instrumental in the creation of this project. This was my first hands-on experience with Django and MySQL without referring to the official documentation.
